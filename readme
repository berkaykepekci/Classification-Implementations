Hello, this repository includes;

 -machine learning implementations/predictions with supervised-classification algorithms (LogisticR.,SVC,RandomForest,GBM,XGB,LGBM...)
 -template codes and roadmap to fit and tune a model. (hyperparameter tuning,early-stopping,oversampling...)
 -template codes to observe the results ( confusion matrix, f1_score, ROC/AUC ...)
  

Datasets I used:



PS:In some methods, I inspired from Mustafa Vahit Keskin and Jason Brownlee.
